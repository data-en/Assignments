    "3. A simple example of a uniform distribution is the roll of a die. When you roll a die, there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each outcome is equally likely, so the probability of rolling any one of them is 1/6.\n",

The height of the rectangle is equal to the probability of any particular outcome, and the width of the rectangle is the range of possible outcomes.In the case of the roll of a die, the height of the rectangle would be 1/6, and the width of the rectangle would be 1 (from 1 to 6).In the case of the drawing of a card from a standard deck of cards, the height of the rectangle would be 1/52, and the width of the rectangle would be 52 (from 1 to 52).\n",
