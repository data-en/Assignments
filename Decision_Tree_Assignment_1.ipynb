    "A Decision Tree Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by partitioning the feature space into segments, creating a tree-like structure of decisions that lead to predictions. Here's how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Construction: Decision Tree starts at the root, picks the best feature to split data, and creates child nodes based on that feature's values. This process is repeated recursively for child nodes until a stopping condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node Purity: The algorithm measures how mixed the classes are in a node using measures like Gini impurity or information gain. It chooses the split that maximizes purity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: To predict, follow the path from the root to a leaf node based on feature conditions. The majority class in that leaf node is the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Features: Handles both categorical and numerical features by comparing values against thresholds for numerical features and testing for equality for categorical features.\n",
