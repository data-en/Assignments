    "    1. Training and validation error: This is one of the most common methods for detecting overfitting. The training error is the error on the training data, while the validation error is the error on a held-out validation dataset. If the training error is much lower than the validation error, then the model is likely overfitting.\n",

    "    3. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a model on unseen data. If the model's performance on the cross-validation dataset is much worse than its performance on the training dataset, then the model is likely overfitting.\n",

    "    5. Model complexity: The complexity of a model can be measured by its number of parameters. If a model has a very large number of parameters, then it is more likely to overfit.\n",

If we see any of the signs of overfitting or underfitting, then we can try to adjust the model's hyperparameters or use different regularization techniques to try to improve the model's performance."
