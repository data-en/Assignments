    "1. Here are some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods:\n",
    "    1. Lasso regression: Lasso regression is a regularized regression method that penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This can help to reduce the number of features that are selected, as the coefficients of less important features will tend to be zeroed out.\n",
    "    2. Ridge regression: Ridge regression is another regularized regression method that penalizes the sum of the squared values of the coefficients. This can also help to reduce the number of features that are selected, as the coefficients of less important features will tend to be shrunk towards zero.\n",
    "    3. Decision trees: Decision trees are a type of non-parametric machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Decision trees can be used to select features by identifying the features that are most important for making accurate predictions.\n",
    "    3. Random forests: Random forests are an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Random forests can be used to select features by identifying the features that are most important for the majority of the decision trees in the forest.\n",
    "2. Embedded feature selection methods are typically more computationally efficient than wrapper methods, but they can be less accurate. This is because embedded methods do not explicitly consider the interaction between features, which can be important for some machine learning models."

This can be a problem for some machine learning models, such as decision trees and random forests, which can be sensitive to feature interactions.\n",
    "    2. Not robust to noise: Filter methods can be sensitive to noise in the data. This is because they rank features based on their individual importance, and noise can artificially inflate the importance of a feature.\n",
    "    3. Not flexible: Filter methods are not very flexible. They typically use a single metric to rank features, and they do not allow for the exploration of different feature combinations.\n",
